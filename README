Started this work more than a decade back as part of learning how Linux kernel work, thought the best way would be to not just read but try out the dirty stuff and experience the pain and pleasure. The development stopped within couple of years and I never revived it :-(. Some day, I will start meros2.0 that would work on a 64 bit system, till then Meros sleeps ....
